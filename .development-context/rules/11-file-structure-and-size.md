### Rule: File Structure and Size

- Keep files under ~200 lines; extract modules/components/services when larger.
- Do not reformat unrelated code during edits.
- Group feature code by domain and UI feature directories already present.

Constraints
- One responsibility per file. Avoid deep nesting (>3 levels).
- Prefer early returns over nested branches.
