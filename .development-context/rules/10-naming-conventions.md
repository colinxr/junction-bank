### Rule: Naming Conventions

- Component files: PascalCase (for example, `NewTransactionModal.tsx`).
- Library/util files: camelCase (for example, `apiClient.ts`).
- Functions are verbs; variables are nouns; no 1â€“2 character names.
- Event handlers start with `handle` (for example, `handleSubmit`).
- Exported/public APIs have explicit TypeScript annotations.
