### Rule: UI and Styling

- Tailwind is the styling system. Do not add ad-hoc CSS files.
- Prefer shadcn/ui components; keep design consistent across pages.
- Use spacing/typography via Tailwind utility classes only.

Constraints
- No inline styles except for dynamic CSS variables when unavoidable.
- Keep component APIs small and composable.
