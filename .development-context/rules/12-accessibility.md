### Rule: Accessibility (a11y)

- Use shadcn/ui and Radix primitives with proper ARIA roles and labels.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible and focus-visible.
- Provide `aria-label`/`aria-describedby` where text is not explicit.

Constraints
- No click-only interactions; ensure Enter/Space handling where applicable.
- Maintain color contrast AA+ with Tailwind tokens.
