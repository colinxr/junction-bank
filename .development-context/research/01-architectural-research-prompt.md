Create a document 02-architectural-research.md
 which details the tools, frameworks and design
 patterns used across the repository.

Pay particular attention to highlight any 
 standards and practices that appear to deviate
 from those that one would expect to find given
 the recommended advice of the language and 
 framework.

The description should include but not be
 limited to highlighting data models, api
 design & versioning, as well as any other
 insights that seem relevant within the
 current state of the repository.

(for legacy systems)
When more than one or conflicting architecture
 or pattern is being used, call this out in the
 document and provide recommendations on the
 best direction forward. Use references to
 external sources which can qualify known best
 practices from software experts.

When it is clear when there is an old or a new
 way of doing things, call out which one is the
 newer pattern.
